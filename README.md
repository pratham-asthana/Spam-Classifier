# Spam-Classifier
# Introduction
Spam message classification is a common problem in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project focuses on building a machine learning model to automatically classify messages as spam or not spam. The project uses various text processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve this task.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of labeled messages from kaggle, where each message is marked as spam or ham. The dataset is available in the data directory named:
'spam.csv' : the main dataset file
# Usage
The project includes several scripts for different stages of the spam classification pipeline. Here are the steps:
- Firstly, the file 'Spam_Classifier.ipynb' has to be executed block by block which will create/update the pickle files along with it.
- To execute the Interface,
  - Open Windows Powershell
  - Open the folder where you saved the programs and files using the command 'cd <your folder name>'
  - Then type the command 'streamlit run Spam-Classifier.py'
